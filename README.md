Instructions:
	- To start place chest on the right side of turtle on the same level 
		and put fuel in turtle inventory. Then change, if needed, the depth and width
		and to_bedrock variable in script and run it.
	- To continue quarry if stopped bring turtle back to starting position
		by chest and run script.
	- If turtle runs out of fuel or has full inventory it will go back to start
		and prompt for fuel or empty inventory. Then continue mining.
	- If you want turtle to go to bedrock set the to_bedrock variable to true,
		if not set it to false.
